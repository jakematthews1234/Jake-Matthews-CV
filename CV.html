    <h1>Projects</h1>

    <p> Project 1:
Live link = https://jakematthews1234.github.io/my_first_marked_project/html/
GitHub link = https://github.com/jakematthews1234/my_first_marked_project
This project was done right after learning the fundamental basics of both HTML and CSS.
The idea was to simply just create a 'band fan page' that consisted of multiple pages. The
project purpose was to focus on some of the core features of web development. Things such
as Responsive Design, Image placement, Text placement and Information Architecture.
Project 2:
Live link = https://jakematthews1234.github.io/milestone-project-2/
GitHub link = https://github.com/jakematthews1234/milestone-project-2
The second project was completed after learning JavaScript fundamentals. Using Google
maps JavaScript API, I created a website in which users could build a holiday idea using
google maps. The features included uses the API to search for things such as hotels, points
of interest and restaurants. This projectâ€™s main focus was to show me how to read, 
understand and use API's in a way that could be used in a simple manner, by anyone,
regardless of IT skill.
Project 3:
Live link = https://mrecipes1.herokuapp.com/
GitHub link = https://github.com/jakematthews1234/Mrecipes
The third project was completed after learning Python fundamentals. The aim of this project
was to create a relational database that can be viewed on a website. I was also tasked with
allowing users the ability to directly change the information stored in the database using all
of the CRUD features. This project's intent was to introduce me to databases, show me how
the information reacts with each other, and how to directly manipulate the data from the front
end.
Project 4: Live link = https://jake-matthews-project-4.herokuapp.com/
GitHub link = https://github.com/jakematthews1234/project_4
The fourth and final project was completed after learning Django fundamentals. Within this
project I was tasked with creating another database. This time, it was to create a website in
which things could be purchased. So, I decided to create an artwork selling website. This
projects focus was to show that I understood how to create multiple Tables within a
database which worked together. I also needed to create user restrictions, depending on
whether a user was signed in or not.</p>
